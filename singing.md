This page explains what you will need to participate in a remote singing
session.

# Setup

## Equipment

| Item | Ideal | Alternative | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|
| Computer | Dedicated laptop or desktop | smartphone | |
| Microphone ("mic") | External plug-in mic<br/>(USB or standard 3.5mm jack) | Use built-in mic on computer / phone | A good quality external mic is going to provide superior sound input. |
| Headphones | Pair of "over the ear" headphones<br/>(USB or standard 3.5mm jack) |  "in the ear" headphones / buds | Required to minimise background noise and hear the rest of the singers as clearly as possible. |
| Network connection | Ethernet cable | wifi! | Most routers / wifi hubs have one or more [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet) sockets on the back. Having a wired connection between your computer and the router provides a more **reliable** and generally **faster** link to the internet. |

## Software

- Register for the free [JamKazam][jamkazam] service.
- Download the free JamKazam application for Windows or MacOS.

## Initial setup

- Plugin your headphones and microphone.
- Start the JamKazam application and login.
- Click the menu button next to your name (top right).
- Click "Audio Gear" and follow the instructions to "Add new gear".
- Click the menu button again.
- Click "Test Network", then "Start network test".

  > **Note:**
  >
  > Unfortunately, this facility seems somewhat unreliable as sometimes it
  > reports, "No network test servers are available".

# Singing session

## Before joining a session

Check the following:

- *Ideally*, no other applications or apps are running on your device

  So close down your web browser, mail client, games, *etc*.

  > **Note:**
  >
  > This includes things like system updates which can really slow down the
  > system and use up your network bandwidth. Consider applying updates a few
  > hours before the meeting and rebooting after the updates complete.

- Your microphone and headphones are plugged in and working.

## On joining a session

- Ensure that once you have joined you:

  - Turn audio *on*

  - Turn video *off*

    Sending and recieving video takes up a lot of "bandwidth" and will
    potentially introduce delays/lag/latency which we need to avoid.

- We may want to record the session.

## After the session

Ask the singers for their view on:

- Audio quality?
- Any noticeable delays?
- Any other thoughts / improvements?

## Software Options

| Application | Opus codec? | Duplex comms? | Viable? | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| ~~[Zoom](https://zoom.us)~~ | Yes | No | No | |
| ~~WhatsApp video chat~~ | Yes | No | No |
| ~~[Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si)~~ | Yes | No | No | No sign up or account required - just create/join a session! |
| [JamKazam][jamkazam] | Yes | Yes | possible | Free service, but unknown how reliable it is. [Servers currently very busy / overloaded][jamkazam-overloaded]. |
| [Jamulus](http://llcon.sourceforge.net) | Yes | Yes | possible | Would require us to run our own private dedicated server. |

**Notes:**

- Opus is the *de facto* and best audio codec available.
- Duplex comms are requires to allow all singers to be heard by each other.

This page explains what you will need to participate in a remote singing
session.

# Setup

## Equipment

| Item | Ideal | Alternative | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|
| Computer | Dedicated laptop or desktop | smartphone | |
| Microphone ("mic") | External plug-in mic<br/>(USB or standard 3.5mm jack) | Use built-in mic on computer / phone | A good quality external mic is going to provide superior sound input. |
| Headphones | Pair of "over the ear" headphones<br/>(USB or standard 3.5mm jack) |  "in the ear" headphones / buds | Required to minimise background noise and hear the rest of the singers as clearly as possible. |

## Software

- [Install Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) on your device.
- Test it works with your mic and headphones.

> **Tip:**
>
> Zoom can be rather *too* clever sometimes and may not use the default system
> "input" (mic) and output (speakers / headphone) device. Check by looking at
> the Zoom settings to ensure you really are using your external microphone
> for example.

# Singing session

## Before joining a session

Check the following:

- *Ideally*, no other application or apps are running on your device

  So close down your web browser, mail client, games, *etc*.

  > **Note:**
  >
  > This includes things like system updates which can really slow down the
  > system and use up your network bandwidth).

- Your microphone and headphones are working.

## On joining a session

- Ensure that once you have joined you:

  - Turn audio *on*

  - Turn video *off*

    Sending and recieving video takes up a lot of "bandwidth" and will
    potentially introduce delays/lag/latency which we need to avoid.

- We may want to record the session.

## After the session

Ask the singers for their view on:

- Audio quality?
- Any noticeable delays?
- Any other thoughts / improvements?

# Appendices

## Alternatives to Zoom

If Zoom isn't good enough, the best alternatives are:

| Application | Uses Opus codec? | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| WhatsApp video chat | Yes | |
| [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si) | Yes | No sign up or account required - just create/join a session! |

Again, video needs to be disabled for these.
